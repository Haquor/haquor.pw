According to a [document](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FBI%20Letter%20to%20Schumer%20re%20FaceApp11.pdf) hosted on senate.gov, the FBI is on high-alert for apps/infrastructure developed in Russia. More specifically, the FBI is worried about the Russian based gender swapping mobile app, FaceApp. 

FaceApp lets users "transform their face using Artificial Intelligence
with just one tap." It lets see what they'd look like with a different face, age or even gender. Sounds fun on the surface. 

But the FBI is worried that FaceApp might be a cyber exploitation software designed by Russia to gather facial recognition data on millions of Americans. 

Scarier yet, if they're right, the Russians have succeeded. In fact, in the last few months the app has really taken off, boasting close to [1 million ratings](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-ai-face-editor/id1180884341) and ranking in the Top 100 most downloaded apps on Apple's Store.

### But why are they worried?

The document mentions that any ISP communication in Russia is effectively tapped and controlled by the FSB. If facial data is backuped up to Russian servers, then Russian intelligence collects it all in the name of counterintelligence.

It's important to remember, this process isn't unique to Russia though. Leaks made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden disclosed a [massive eavesdropping framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)) that creates backdoors for U.S. intelligence in American companies & ISPs.

Just as the FSB taps into all Russian servers, the FBI/CIA/NSA tap into American servers. As a result, American citizens have no expectation of privacy.

What this memo DOES reveal, is that U.S. intelligence struggles to keep control of its citizens data. Every year, U.S. citizens [personal data is sold and traded between data brokers](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-personal-data-collection/) both in and outside of the United States.

Hackers have been observed [selling the data of U.S. citizens](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/the-market-for-stolen-account-credentials/) collected by American firms such as Equifax, Experian and Transunion as a counterintelligence asset to foreign countries.

Since lawmakers refuse to hold data brokers, large companies and collection firms accountable, it looks like it's up to U.S. intelligence to protect user data from falling into the hands of foreign rivals.
