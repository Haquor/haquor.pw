Today RIPE has announced it officially assigned the last available IPv4 address range

> Dear colleagues,
> Today, at 15:35 UTC+1 on 25 November 2019, we made our final /22 IPv4 allocation from the last remaining addresses in our available pool. We have now run out of IPv4 addresses. 
> <cite>RIPE NCC</cite>

Since their pool is now exhausted, providers can add their information to a waiting list to reserve new IP allocation as they become available. When an organization no longer needs their range, it will return to the pool to be reassigned.

This recent news begs the question, will consumers see an effect? And will it prompt more widescale IPv6 adoption.

Although dual-stack v4+v6 NICs have become the norm, not all ISPs have adopted complete IPv6 support. There's also a distinct lack of v6 support for IoT devices, which are becoming exceedingly common

Rather than acting as a wakeup call for mainstream V6 adoption, some users suggest the RIPE announcement may prompt a spike in cost for IP ranges as organizations battle over an increasingly rare resource.
