Tomorrow Unlocked has released has a new documentary in their hacker:HUNTER series. A documentary detailing the legendary story of one of our InfoSec heroes, Marcus Hutchins and his struggle with law enforcement after being cast into the cyber security limelight through his wizard like ability to halt the disastrous WannaCry ransomware worm.

It features a detailed narrative told by Hutchins himself about his response to WannaCry and why only a month after saving the world from the ransomware, he found himself in FBI custody.

It's a must watch, cautionary tale about the two-faced nature of the IT security industry.
