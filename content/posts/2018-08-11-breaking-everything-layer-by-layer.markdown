By now, I'm quite deep into my studies, and I see it only fitting to exercise the ideas I'm learning through practice. Through thousands of pages of academic literature, a common theme has emerged: security through _simplicity._

It's easy to get lost in a sea of technical specs & standards when dealing with computer security.

As a response, I'm going to make this simple, for others, and myself.

I propose, a comprehensive, week by week hacking blog that steps through the layers of the OSI model, detailing the vulnerabilities of applications & protocols at every level.

I'll discuss the strengths, vulnerabilities and potential improvements for common protocols that build the backbone of each layer.

Hopefully I'll be able to apply everything I've learned about **[Systems](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/systems), [Databases](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/databases), [Networking](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/networking), [Cryptography](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/cryptography), [Hacking](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/hacking), [Web Applications](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/webapps)Â  **and **[Information Security Practices](https://haquor.wordpress.com/category/infosec).**
