Ever sign up for your favorite site? Fill out all your info, set your password. Then suddenly, you get a page full of strange questions?

1. What's your favorite undersea mollusk? 
2. How many pets have you had?  
3. What's color is your mother's brother's hair?

You answer them honestly, because only you would know the answers....**right?**

Wrong. Security questions are one of the most common (and easiest) methods for hacking into an account.

Now, many companies are switching from asking for _only_ the security question to grant account access. Many are only using it as 1 layer of a multi-layer password reset procedure. However, many still let you reset your password with just the security question.

Out of all the "Forgot My Password" requirements, security answer is the easiest to guess.

[Social Engineers](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2124681/what-is-social-engineering.html) spend their entire criminal careers researching a person's social media, background and personal information. Think the name of your first pet is a big secret? Not when you make a memorial post to your 1st cat sparkles on your Facebook page.

What about the maiden name of your mother? It's out there. Public sources host thousands of marriage records. Nearly every simplistic security question can be found simply over the internet.  

##  Humans as the Weakest Link 

It's common knowledge in the InfoSec community that [human beings are the weakest link in the cyber security chain](https://www.cio.com/article/3191088/humans-are-still-the-weakest-cybersecurity-link.html). Once a social engineer has access to a list of everyone in your social circle they can send emails that **appear** to be from friends of friends. 

Sometimes they cold call pretending to be a company you know to collect data that might answer your security questions. Hell, if they have physical access, they can **send a stranger in** to befriend you and learn the name of your first pet. Most of these questions are so benign that people answer them with no hesitation.

## How do I fix it?

Almost every website that asks security questions also asks you to set an account password. That password will **always** have complexity requirements. Your password is not allowed to be cat or dog.

Folks, we shouldn't answer our security questions honestly. Instead, we should use **backup passwords** as the answers. When creating these backup passwords you should follow these government grade requirements ([NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)):

  1. A minimum of eight characters and a maximum length of at least 64 characters  
  2. The ability to use all special characters but no special requirement to use them
  3. Restrict sequential and repetitive characters (e.g. 12345 or aaaaaa)
  4. Restrict context specific passwords (e.g. the name of the site, etc.)
  5. Restrict commonly used passwords (e.g. p@ssw0rd, etc.) and dictionary words 





Another next-level way to protect yourself?







Use branch databases to check if the password you've chosen has been hacked before. If it has? It's much more likely for hackers to attempt that password on your account.
